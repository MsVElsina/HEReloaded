# HE_REloaded for (UE 4.24)
Name subject to change, 
This is my modified version of the Free Horror Engine Asset for Unreal
The goal of this project is to expand and improve the amazing HorrorEngine Asset

The original HE asset was Developed by tansuergene


The asset was made free to the public Sept 1st 2019
in its current state reloaded only adds a few extra features not found in the base asset
but most would concider these features Key to a horror experience 
These are: 
- Save Load system (Developed by HEs original dev but missing from release version)
- Checkpoint BP
- In game Pause Menu
- Main menu level
- Very basic Graphics options
- Player body
- Fixed Footsteps trigger based on Animation instead of Delays/Timers
- AI with basic footsteps, attacking animations and deals damage
- Ghost type enemies (use special equipment to see them)
- Reworked weapon system
